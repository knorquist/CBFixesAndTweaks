# CBFixesAndTweaks

This project is a fork of fascinatingcaptain's github repo. The audio tweaks have been removed, since audio support for Gandof is now in the current kernel. This also means the logic for checking for Swanky or Gandof was unnecessary, and was also removed.

This script should work on any version of the Toshiba Chromebook 2. I would **assume** but cannot confirm that it will work on most any chromebook with the same keyboard layout - but that's a big **assume**, so don't get mad at me when it doesn't work.

This script comes with no warranties, guarantees of function, etc.

# Instructions

Download or clone the repo and run the script:

`sudo ./CBFixesAndTweaks.sh`

Let it do it's thing, and then reboot and log back in. Voila! Media keys mapped!
